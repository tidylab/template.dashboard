Description: Any R package may include functions, tests, documentation and data. 
    While the content between packages is different, package development tools 
    and processes are often similar. `template.package` aims at:  
    * Letting the R programmer focus on what’s important – developing the package content;  
    * Speeding-up development time by reducing rework time spent on development tools setup; and  
    * Laying the infrastructure needed for some good software development practices such as test-driven development.  
    `template.package` includes:  
    * Fully configured test-suite, including code-coverage;   
    * Fully configured continuous-integration (CI) script for Travis; and  
    * Fully configured continuous-development (CD) script for Travis.
